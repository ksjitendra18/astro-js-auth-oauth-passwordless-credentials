# Astro Authentication Guide: Google Github OAuth Guide, Email Password

This repo is for the series of blog post covering Authentication in Astro.

## Technolgies Used

- Turso DB
- Drizzle ORM
- Redis for storing verification codes
- Resend for sending emails
- Solid.js
- Zod
- Database session strategy for auth persistence
- Bcrypt for password encryption

I am not using any external auth library for this guide. At the moment of writing Auth.js doesn't support Astro. In a separate blog I will do all these authentication strategy through Lucia Auth.

Here are the strategies with their starter code, finished code and also the related blog post.

## 1. Oauth (Google and Github)
