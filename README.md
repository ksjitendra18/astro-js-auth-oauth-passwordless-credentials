# Astro Authentication Guide: Google Github OAuth Guide, Email Password

This repo is for the series of blog post covering Authentication in Astro.

Main branch contains the latest updated code. If you're following the blog post, please use the specific branch for the post.

## Technolgies Used

- Turso DB
- Drizzle ORM
- Redis for storing verification codes and rate limiting
- Resend for sending emails
- Solid.js
- Zod
- Database session strategy for auth persistence
- Argon2 for password encryption

I am not using any external auth library for this guide. At the moment of writing, Auth.js doesn't support Astro. In a separate blog post I will do all these authentication strategy through Lucia Auth.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
``` 

Now copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values.

Please refer to blog post for github and google oauth setup.

You will need Turso DB and Redis for it. You can use sqlite or choose other database but you will have to make changes in the schema. For Redis, I am using Upstash Redis.

To run the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev 
``` 


Here are the strategies with their starter code, finished code and also the related blog post.
